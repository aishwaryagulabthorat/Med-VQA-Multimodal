If it's pointing towards an irregular or discontinuous line in the bone, it could indicate a bone fracture. If the arrowhead is pointing towards a dark area in a muscle, it could indicate a muscle tear. If it's pointing to a region between two bones, it could indicate cartilage damage. \n",

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.', 'The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.'], 'labels': ['BACKGROUND', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Alismataceae', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Mitochondria', 'Plant Leaves'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}, 'long_answer': 'Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.', 'final_decision': 'yes'}\n"

            "PubMed Question: Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?\n",
            "PubMed Context: Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger. We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed no major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that of large but superficial tumors. Tumor depth influenced the prognosis in the subset of high-grade and large tumors. In this subset deep-seated tumors had poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors.\n",

            "PubMed Context: Multislice helical computed tomography (CT), which can provide detailed 2-D and 3-D reconstructed images, is useful in imaging diagnosis for dental implant treatment. Therefore, in this study, it was performed to clarify the mandibular depiction of double-oblique reconstructed images when changing their thickness. A total of 38 sites in the mandibular molar region were examined using multislice helical CT. The thicknesses of the double-oblique images using multislice helical CT scans were reconstructed in 4 conditions: 0.3 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.6 mm, and 4.1 mm. In double-oblique images, mandibular depiction was evaluated by 5 oral radiologists using a subjective rating score. In the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal, the highest value was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images; however, there was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images.\n",

            "PubMed Context: It has been demonstrated that hiatal hernia repair (HHR) during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) decreases the rate of reoperation. However, the technical aspects (location and number of sutures) are not standardized. It is unknown whether such technical details are associated with differing rates of reoperation for band-related problems. A retrospective analysis was performed from a single institution, including 2,301 patients undergoing LAGB with HHR from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Independent variables were number and location of sutures. Data collected included demographics, operating room (OR) time, length of stay (LOS), follow-up time, postoperative BMI/%EWL, and rates of readmission/reoperation. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and Chi squared tests. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression tests were used for follow-up data and reoperation rates, in order to account for differential length of follow-up and confounding variables. There was no difference in length of follow-up among all groups. The majority of patients had one suture (range 1-6; 55 %). Patients with fewer sutures had shorter OR time (1 suture 45 min vs. 4+ sutures 56 min, p<0.0001). LOS, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postop BMI/%EWL were not statistically significant. Anterior suture placement (vs. posterior vs. both) was most common (61 %). OR time was shorter in those with anterior suture (41 min vs. posterior 56 min vs. both 59 min, p<0.0001). Patients with posterior suture had a longer LOS (84 % 1 day vs. anterior 74 % 1 day vs. both 74 % 1 day, p<0.0001). There was no difference in 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative BMI/%EWL.\n",

            "PubMed Context: The use of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound may help to determine the exact position of the needle during breast biopsy, thereby reducing the number of core samples that are needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) of the breast. A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained. A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%.\n",

            "PubMed Context: Although its excellent results, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) presents major complications ranging from 0% to 29%. Among them, the staple line leak presents an incidence varying from 0% to 7%. Many trials debated about different solutions in order to reduce leaks' incidence. No author has investigated the role of gastric decompression in the prevention of this complication. Aim of our work is to evaluate if this procedure can play a role in avoiding the occurrence of staple line leaks after LSG. Between January 2008 and November 2012, 145 patients were prospectively and randomly included in the study. Seventy patients composed the group A, whose operations were completed with placement of nasogastric tube; the other 75 patients were included in the group B, in which no nasogastric tube was placed. No statistical differences were observed between group A and group B regarding gender distribution, age, weight, and BMI. No intraoperative complications and no conversion occurred in both groups. Intraoperative blood loss (50.1 ± 42.3 vs. 52.5 ± 37.6 ml, respectively) and operative time (65.4 ± 25.5 vs. 62.6 ± 27.8 min, respectively) were comparable between the two groups (p: NS). One staple line leak (1.4%) occurred on 6th postoperative day in group A patients. No leak was observed in group B patients.

Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised.\n",

            "PubMed Context: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been reported as a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia with positron emission tomography (PET). The hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of FDG under hypoxic conditions secondary to enhanced glycolysis, compensating the hypoxia-induced loss of cellular energy production. Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models. C3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic®, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air n=4, SCCVII, n=5) and under hypoxic conditions (10% O(2) breathing n=4). On AR, under both ambient air and hypoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes. Under normoxic conditions, when comparing the 10% of tumor voxels with the highest (18)F-FDG or (14)C-EF3 activity, a DSI of 0.24 and 0.20 was found for FSAII and SCCVII, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, a DSI of 0.36 was observed for SCCVII tumors. When comparing the (14)C-EF3 distribution in AR with the corresponding (18)F-FDG-PET images, the DSI reached values of 0.26, 0.22 and 0.21 for FSAII and SCCVII under normoxia and SCCVII under hypoxia, respectively.\n",

            "PubMed Context: We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography. We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression. We identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent.\n",
            "PubMed Long Answer: After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.\n",

Twelve foot measurements were collected on 52 individuals (mean age 25.8 years) with the change in midfoot width used to place subjects in a pronated or normal foot mobility group. Dynamic plantar contact area was collected during walking with a pressure sensor platform. The 12 measures were entered into a stepwise regression analysis to determine the optimal set of measures associated with regional plantar surface area. A two variable model was found to describe the relationship between the foot measurements and forefoot plantar contact area (r(2)=0.79, p<0.0001). A four variable model was found to describe the relationship between the foot measurements and midfoot plantar contact area (r(2)=0.85, p<0.0001) in those individuals with a 1.26cm or greater change in midfoot width.\n",
            "PubMed Long Answer: The results indicate that clinicians can use a combination of simple, reliable and time efficient foot measures to explain 79% and 85% of the plantar surface area in the forefoot and midfoot, respectively.\n",

            "PubMed Context: We evaluated the differences between percutaneous ethanol injection with and without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid for treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules. We examined 60 patients with benign cystic thyroid nodules confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and divided them into 2 groups according to nonaspiration (group A, n = 30) or aspiration (group B, n = 30) of ethanol-mixed fluid after intracystic ethanol injection. We evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and the total procedure time (Student t test). Most patients showed complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule (group A, n = 29; group B, n = 28), and they revealed no recurrence on follow-up ultrasonography. There was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P>.05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups (P>.05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P<.05) and the complaint of all group B patients due to a double puncture (P<.001). The total procedure time was nearly double in group B than in group A because of the additional procedures, such as complete evacuation of the ethanol-mixed fluid and the 10-minute compression.\n",

            "PubMed Context: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible. Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2). Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p<0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%).\n",

From 1993 to 1999, 667 patients received curative lung resection and complete hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. Of these, there were 436 Stage I disease (65%), of whom 144 T1N0 and 292 T2N0. No patients had pre- or postoperative radio- or chemotherapy. Prognostic significance of the following independent variables was tested using univariate (log-rank) and multivariate (Cox proportional-hazards) analysis: type of resection (sublobar vs lobectomy vs pneumonectomy), histology (squamous cell vs adenocarcinoma), tumour size (<or=3cm vs>3cm), histologic vascular invasion, visceral pleura involvement, positive bronchial resection margin, general T status. Overall 5-year survival was 63%. In both univariate and multivariate survival analysis, significant prognostic factors were histology (adenocarcinoma 65% vs squamous cell carcinoma 51%), tumour size (<or=3cm 67% vs>3cm 46%), and the presence of negative resection margin. Five-year survival by general T status was 66% in T1N0 vs 55% in T2N0 disease (P=0.19).\n",

            "PubMed Context: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between LR and SE.\n",
            "PubMed Long Answer: Using the charts described, there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have to be considered.\n",

            "PubMed Context: Broad-based electronic health information exchange (HIE), in which patients' clinical data follow them between care delivery settings, is expected to produce large quality gains and cost savings. Although these benefits are assumed to result from reducing redundant care, there is limited supporting empirical evidence. To evaluate whether HIE adoption is associated with decreases in repeat imaging in emergency departments (EDs).DATA SOURCE/ ED discharge data from the State Emergency Department Databases for California and Florida for 2007-2010 were merged with Health Information Management Systems Society data that report hospital HIE participation. Using regression with ED fixed effects and trends, we performed a retrospective analysis of the impact of HIE participation on repeat imaging, comparing 37 EDs that initiated HIE participation during the study period to 410 EDs that did not participate in HIE during the same period. Within 3 common types of imaging tests [computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chest x-ray), we defined a repeat image for a given patient as the same study in the same body region performed within 30 days at unaffiliated EDs. In our sample there were 20,139 repeat CTs (representing 14.7% of those cases with CT in the index visit), 13,060 repeat ultrasounds (20.7% of ultrasound cases), and 29,703 repeat chest x-rays (19.5% of x-ray cases). HIE was associated with reduced probability of repeat ED imaging in all 3 modalities: -8.7 percentage points for CT [95% confidence interval (CI): -14.7, -2.7], -9.1 percentage points for ultrasound (95% CI: -17.2, -1.1), and -13.0 percentage points for chest x-ray (95% CI: -18.3, -7.7), reflecting reductions of 44%-67% relative to sample means.\n",

            "PubMed Context: Recently, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) has been suggested as a cause of gait impairment and unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders. A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second ≤16). Among 93 subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2). Although four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with antimyoclonic treatment, the follow-up was not systematic enough to evaluate their therapeutic effect on OM.\n",

            "Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger. We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed no major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that of large but superficial tumors. Tumor depth influenced the prognosis in the subset of high-grade and large tumors. In this subset deep-seated tumors had poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors.\n",

A total of 38 sites in the mandibular molar region were examined using multislice helical CT. The thicknesses of the double-oblique images using multislice helical CT scans were reconstructed in 4 conditions: 0.3 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.6 mm, and 4.1 mm. In double-oblique images, mandibular depiction was evaluated by 5 oral radiologists using a subjective rating score. In the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal, the highest value was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images; however, there was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images.\n",

            "It has been demonstrated that hiatal hernia repair (HHR) during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) decreases the rate of reoperation. However, the technical aspects (location and number of sutures) are not standardized. It is unknown whether such technical details are associated with differing rates of reoperation for band-related problems. A retrospective analysis was performed from a single institution, including 2,301 patients undergoing LAGB with HHR from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Independent variables were number and location of sutures. Data collected included demographics, operating room (OR) time, length of stay (LOS), follow-up time, postoperative BMI/%EWL, and rates of readmission/reoperation. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and Chi squared tests. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression tests were used for follow-up data and reoperation rates, in order to account for differential length of follow-up and confounding variables. There was no difference in length of follow-up among all groups. The majority of patients had one suture (range 1-6; 55 %). Patients with fewer sutures had shorter OR time (1 suture 45 min vs. 4+ sutures 56 min, p<0.0001). LOS, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postop BMI/%EWL were not statistically significant. Anterior suture placement (vs. posterior vs. both) was most common (61 %). OR time was shorter in those with anterior suture (41 min vs. posterior 56 min vs. both 59 min, p<0.0001). Patients with posterior suture had a longer LOS (84 % 1 day vs. anterior 74 % 1 day vs. both 74 % 1 day, p<0.0001).

Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained. A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%.\n",

Among them, the staple line leak presents an incidence varying from 0% to 7%. Many trials debated about different solutions in order to reduce leaks' incidence. No author has investigated the role of gastric decompression in the prevention of this complication. Aim of our work is to evaluate if this procedure can play a role in avoiding the occurrence of staple line leaks after LSG. Between January 2008 and November 2012, 145 patients were prospectively and randomly included in the study. Seventy patients composed the group A, whose operations were completed with placement of nasogastric tube; the other 75 patients were included in the group B, in which no nasogastric tube was placed. No statistical differences were observed between group A and group B regarding gender distribution, age, weight, and BMI. No intraoperative complications and no conversion occurred in both groups. Intraoperative blood loss (50.1 ± 42.3 vs. 52.5 ± 37.6 ml, respectively) and operative time (65.4 ± 25.5 vs. 62.6 ± 27.8 min, respectively) were comparable between the two groups (p: NS). One staple line leak (1.4%) occurred on 6th postoperative day in group A patients. No leak was observed in group B patients.

Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised.\n",

            "Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been reported as a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia with positron emission tomography (PET). The hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of FDG under hypoxic conditions secondary to enhanced glycolysis, compensating the hypoxia-induced loss of cellular energy production. Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models. C3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic®, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air n=4, SCCVII, n=5) and under hypoxic conditions (10% O(2) breathing n=4). On AR, under both ambient air and hypoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes. Under normoxic conditions, when comparing the 10% of tumor voxels with the highest (18)F-FDG or (14)C-EF3 activity, a DSI of 0.24 and 0.20 was found for FSAII and SCCVII, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, a DSI of 0.36 was observed for SCCVII tumors. When comparing the (14)C-EF3 distribution in AR with the corresponding (18)F-FDG-PET images, the DSI reached values of 0.26, 0.22 and 0.21 for FSAII and SCCVII under normoxia and SCCVII under hypoxia, respectively.\n",

We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression. We identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity.

Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models. C3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic®, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air n=4, SCCVII, n=5) and under hypoxic conditions (10% O(2) breathing n=4). On AR, under both ambient air and hypoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes. Under normoxic conditions, when comparing the 10% of tumor voxels with the highest (18)F-FDG or (14)C-EF3 activity, a DSI of 0.24 and 0.20 was found for FSAII and SCCVII, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, a DSI of 0.36 was observed for SCCVII tumors. When comparing the (14)C-EF3 distribution in AR with the corresponding (18)F-FDG-PET images, the DSI reached values of 0.26, 0.22 and 0.21 for FSAII and SCCVII under normoxia and SCCVII under hypoxia, respectively.\n",

Twelve foot measurements were collected on 52 individuals (mean age 25.8 years) with the change in midfoot width used to place subjects in a pronated or normal foot mobility group. Dynamic plantar contact area was collected during walking with a pressure sensor platform. The 12 measures were entered into a stepwise regression analysis to determine the optimal set of measures associated with regional plantar surface area. A two variable model was found to describe the relationship between the foot measurements and forefoot plantar contact area (r(2)=0.79, p<0.0001).

Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2). Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p<0.025).

In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders. A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second ≤16). Among 93 subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2).

            "Multislice helical computed tomography (CT), which can provide detailed 2-D and 3-D reconstructed images, is useful in imaging diagnosis for dental implant treatment. Therefore, in this study, it was performed to clarify the mandibular depiction of double-oblique reconstructed images when changing their thickness. A total of 38 sites in the mandibular molar region were examined using multislice helical CT. The thicknesses of the double-oblique images using multislice helical CT scans were reconstructed in 4 conditions: 0.3 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.6 mm, and 4.1 mm. In double-oblique images, mandibular depiction was evaluated by 5 oral radiologists using a subjective rating score. In the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal, the highest value was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images; however, there was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images.\n",
